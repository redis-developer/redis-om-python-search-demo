He’s not one for sitting still for long, he enjoys being up and on the go whenever he can, so a family who enjoys keeping on the move will suit him perfectly. He is a playful boy and can still be mouthy when excited so we feel he could live with confident dogs,who are used to a boisterous player. George gets on really well with other dogs and we feel it would really benefit him to live with another dog in his new home. He may be small, but his personality really makes up for this and so does his voice, he likes to make himself known wherever he is and can be quite vocal so new owners will need to be prepared to have a chatty dog.

Sasha is a very affectionate, loving little cat. She adores people and lots of attention, she likes to be with you so much that she often ops to sleep at the end of your bed every night."
Scout,cat,5,7,m,50,y,n,"We love this little guy, he is a popular and friendly little dude.  He was brought into our care due to his owner passing away and has settled in well.  He clearly misses his creature comforts and is looking for his forever home and a family to call his own."
Pepper,cat,4,7,m,55,y,y,"Pepper came to us after he was found as a stray. He is around 4 years old and is looking for an adult only home. As he was a stray for quite a long time, he is used to coming and going as he pleases and may spend quite a bit of time outdoors. He is a friendly cat and can be handled. Pepper can feel anxious when confined but will come out for food and will come to you for some gentle strokes."
Shadow,dog,3,38,f,60,n,n,"Shadow is looking for a quiet adult only home with an experienced owner who has had similar dogs before. She can be very mistrustful of people and is easily overwhelmed in busy or noisy situations. She can be fearful of the outside world and does need a garden where she can come and go as she pleases. She is house-trained, can be left alone for short periods of time and does like to travel in the car."
Smudge,dog,12,17,m,45,y,n,"Smudge is an energtic boy who's had a bit of a turbulent life. He is looking for understanding, patient owners who have lots of time for their new companion. He would love a home where he has a secure garden to spend some time and to work on his housetraining."
Cotton,dog,13,23,m,40,n,n,"Cotton is a handsome prince! He is fun, affectionate, and loves to spend time in the company of people he knows. It can take him a while to build his confidence around you but once he has, he will be a friend for life. He is clever, active and sensitive. He would really love a home where he can get lots of exercise and mental stimulation and gain confidence with his new family in his own time."
Bolt,cat,10,10,m,30,n,y,"Bolt is a confident young man who needs an experienced home who can read his signals when he becomes uncomfortable. He is happy to be stroked but can become frustrated at times, so can live with teenagers who will respect his space when he needs it."
Tulip,dog,11,38,f,35,n,y,"Tulip is seeking an active lifestyle where she can have lots of exciting adventures offered to her. She will also require someone strong enough to hold her on the lead as she is a very strong and rather determined little diva! Tulip's family would benefit a lot from breed experience, particularly in terms of the more aloof nature in the early days."
Belinda,dog,4,41,f,60,n,y,"Belinda is looking for an adult only home, with a large, very secure garden. She would like to live with a small to medium sized male dog ideally 2 - 5 years old who is confident, well socialised and playful who can act as Belinda's guardian. She could build up to being left approx 4 hours a day once settled."
Snowball,dog,3,32,m,85,y,y,"Snowball is a sweet and loving little gent once you get to know him, and he wants nothing more than to curl up on your lap! He has some worries around grooming so his forever home will need to invest lots of time working through these worries with him. He also doesn't think much of the TV! So would much prefer a home that enjoy other activities such as reading books. He does however LOVE soft toys, often seen carrying them around in his mouth."
Bruno,dog,2,21,m,75,y,y,"A rural home is top of Bruno's wishlist, where he can enjoy life without the worry of loud noises or lots of disturbances. A family with collie experience and a good understanding of dog body language will be essential to Bruno's success, and it must be fully understood that hands-on fuss is not Bruno's favourite thing until he really knows and trusts you."
Ainsley,cat,10,6,m,20,n,n,"Ainsley came into care as his owner sadly died. He is 12 years old and has recently undergone dental surgery to extract multiple rotten teeth. Ainsley is not coping with rescue life very well and we would very much like to find him a new home as soon as possible. We think that Ainsley would be suited to an adult-only home or one where any,are of secondary school age."
Betty,cat,3,11,f,60,y,y,"Betty was quite timid when she first came into us so we are looking for a quieter home where she can take her time to settle. Once she has gained confidence in you she is a lovely friendly cat."
Cheddar,cat,12,5,m,30,y,y,"Meet Cheddar, he was rescued by one of our officers after a member of the public had reported him as a stray. Cheddar had been hanging around the local area for a few days, when he arrived he was suffering from a heavy flea burden which had caused a mild skin condition. With a simple flea treatment Cheddar soon recovered and now he is ready to find a new home."
Sprinkles,cat,11,9,f,35,n,y,"This gorgeous lad is called Sprinkles. He is a friendly, confident lad who is not overly needy but does enjoy having some fuss, but when he has had enough he will take himself off. Sprinkles will occasionally have a little play with some toys, but he doesn't have huge enthusiasm for that particular pastime."
Logan,cat,9,13,m,35,y,n,"Logan is an affectionate boy who is full of fun and loves to play. He would be best as the only pet in the house."
Mavis,dog,11,34,f,40,y,y,"Mavis absolutely loves her food and toys, but is not the biggest fan of sharing; our team have dedicated a lot of time to 'swapsies' work which will need to be continued in her home. Mavis will need a high level of physical exercise as she is happiest when on-the-go (particularly if a source of water may be near!). She does have cataracts which doesn't seem to affect her too much, but this may worsen with time as she gets older."
Patch,dog,12,41,m,40,y,y,"A medium level of physical exercise will be needed to keep Patch happy and healthy, and he will need a family who are willing to invest time into his training in a few areas; Handling, reacting to dogs and seperation anxiety are his main areas to work on. Patch is not housetrained but has lived in a home before. He really does not like being left on his own so this will need to be built-up gradually."
